# Predicting Smoking Status from Medical data

The problem of smoking is a significant public health concern with far-reaching negative effects
on individuals and society. Not only does smoking harm nearly every organ of the body and
increase the risk of numerous diseases, such as lung cancer and heart disease, but it also reduces
the life expectancy of smokers. Despite this, smoking remains a prevalent habit and the number of
deaths caused by smoking is projected to reach 10 million by 2030, according to a World Health
Organization report. Furthermore, evidence-based treatment options for smoking cessation, such
as counseling, have been proposed and promoted but be ineffective and time-consuming for many
physicians. 


## Problem Definition

This analysis intends to identify the best classification and predictors to identify how various
attributes point toward a smoker which eventually leads to other numerous diseases. We look for
information from attributes such as systolic (measures the pressure in your arteries when your heart
beats), hemoglobin measurement in blood, glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase type (an enzyme
found in the liver, heart, and other tissues) which measures liver and heart damage along with few
more attributes.

## Data Description

There are two datasets available for addressing the problem, one is a Train dataset, and the other
is a test dataset. The training dataset consists of 38984 instances and 23 attributes, whereas the test
dataset consists of 16709 instances and 22 attributes. Data presents us with the physical and health
parameters of each subject as mentioned below. In the test dataset, column “Smoking” is not
present as this parameter will be predicted with the trained model. Attribute “Smoking” is our
target variable.
